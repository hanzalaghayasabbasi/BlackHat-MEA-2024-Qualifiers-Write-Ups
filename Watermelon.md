   Next, I logged in using the newly created username and obtained the session cookie. I then copied the session cookie.

3. **Exploration and Exploitation**

   Upon analysis, I discovered that the admin password is stored in `app/app.py`. I also identified a file traversal vulnerability in the `/upload` directory.

   The files are stored in `/file/1`. Initially, Burp Suite didn't reveal much, so I used `curl` to retrieve the `app.py` file. As a result, I successfully obtained the admin password.
